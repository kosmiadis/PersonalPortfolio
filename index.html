                    <span>Hello there,</span>
                    my name is Vagelis Kosmiadis, I am 16 years old and I am a self-taught web developer, that lives in Thessaloniki, Greece.

                <p>I am currently at the first-grade of senior high-school. I like experimenting
                    with JavaScript and generally speaking making websites! My journey started almost 1,5 years
                    ago when I got my first Laptop. I use to get easilly attracted by computers 
                    and techologies around it. Coding makes me feel free and creative while doing projects.
                    In my spare time I really like working out, cooking and hanging out with friends. </p>
